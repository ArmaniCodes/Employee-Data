## Employee Data Manager
Manage employee data for thousands of employees while being able to retrieve statistics and visualize them with graphs. This program utilizes SQLite3 to store data locally. Tkinter is employed for displaying and allowing modification of employee data. Matplotlib is utilized to visually represent employee statistics through graphs, providing an insightful overview of the data.
As data is stored locally, it's important to note that this project is not intended for deployment in a real-world corporate environment, but it's a visually fun and great way to learn about SQL and GUIS.
